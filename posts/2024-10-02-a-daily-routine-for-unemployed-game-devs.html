<h1>A Daily Routine For Unemployed Game Devs</h1>
<h4>2 October 2024</h4>
<p>🕹 Unemployed as a game developer? Here's how I'm staying on track and keeping my spirits up.</p>
<p>I've crafted a simple daily routine that's been essential for my mental well-being and productivity during this period.</p>
<ul>
<li>Mornings: Create 🎨</li>
<li>Mid-days: Connect 📨</li>
<li>Afternoons: ​Contribute 🙌🏽</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>CREATE</strong>: This is all about building skills and creative growth.</p>
<p>While the timing of my next opportunity is uncertain, I'm making the most of this time by exploring new technologies, building games, and honing my craft.</p>
<p><strong>CONNECT</strong>: This phase is all about maximizing opportunities.</p>
<p>Whether it's reaching out to my network, applying for roles, or sharing my latest work, I'm just trying to keep the momentum going.</p>
<p><strong>CONTRIBUTE</strong>: Giving back to the community is key.</p>
<p>Whether it's helping others in their job search, collaborating on indie projects, or participating in game jams, assisting others is how we're all going to get through this.</p>
<p>🌟 And here's one last bonus...</p>
<p><strong>EVENINGS</strong>: Community​ Evenings are dedicated to recharging with loved ones. It's my time to unplug, rest, and cherish moments with friends and family.</p>
<p>I'd love to hear what strategies have been working for you as you navigate your job search.</p>
